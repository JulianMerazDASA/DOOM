        <h3>Combat Shotgun</h3>
          <p>First weapon you get, uses shells, weakest in the game. Gets grenades or revolving barrel mods</p>
		  <h3>Plasma Rifle</h3>
		  <p>Comes from the first DOOM game. ~add what kind of ammo it uses here~. You can unlock Microwave Beam and Heat Blast mods. Can be used to destroy energy shields.</P>
		  <h3>Ballista</h3>
		  <p>Uses the same ammo as the Plasma Rifle. Shoots a powerful beam and takes time to recharge. Does extra damage to flying demons like the Cacodemon.</p>
		  <h3>Chaingun</h3>
		  <p>Uses 
      <h2>Demons</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Imp</li>
        <li>Cacodemon</li>
        <li>Mancubus</li>
        <li>Makyr Drone</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Imp</h3>
      <p>One of the first enemies. Can attack when near and can throw fireballs. It also runs around and can climb walls.</p>
        <h3>Cacodemon</h3>
        <p>My favorite demon because of it's design. It's weakness is it's eye and throwing a grenade in it's mouth. It flies around, bites you, and shoots fireballs.</p>
        <h3>Mancubus</h3>
		<p>Has arm cannons to shoot you and can leave an effect on the ground to block it off. It's weaknesses are it's arms.</p>
		<h3>Makyr Drone</h3>
		<p>Shoots beams at you and dodges attacks. It's weakness is it's head, you have to snipe it but it drops a lot of ammo.</p>
